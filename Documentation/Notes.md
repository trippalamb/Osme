# Osme Notes



## Containers

### Tuple `[]`

```
Tuple stuff = ['hello', 42, true]

function doSomething[arg1, arg2, arg3]
	String :: arg1
end function doSomething
```



### Sub Expression `()`

```
Real x = 5.0 * (y + z)
```



### Vector/Matrix `<>`

these are really supposed to be angle brackets not less than and greater than signs $\langle$ and $\rangle$

```
Real<3> pos = <1.0, 2.0, 3.0>
```



### JSON Dictionary `{}`

Dictionary is a named tuple

```json
Dictionary dict = {
    title: "Hello",
    something: 42,
    yes: true
}
```



### Qubit `<0|` or `|1>`

these are really supposed to be angle brackets not less than and greater than signs $\langle$ and $\rangle$
